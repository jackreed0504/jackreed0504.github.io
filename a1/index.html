          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?
          <p>
            The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the
            experience was the animations, which evoke the appearance of vintage
            lithographic-printed travel posters from the mid 20th century.

          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
          <p>I spent the most time panning around the various scenes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
          <p>
            My most common actions were tied between dragging along the screen
            to pan the scene, and dragging the wheel (7 times each)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
          <p>
            I think the intended goal of the experience is to advertise a
            Richard Mille watch. The introduction describes the experience as “A
            tribute to the grand unveiling of the RM 07-01 coloured ceramics”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
          <p>
            The experience uses interactive digital media techniques to immerse
            the user into a series of animated scenes which evoke the design
            aesthetics of the advertised watch. Reflecting the bright colours
            and retro design aesthetics of the Memphis design influenced watch,
            the animations depict vibrant images of summertime and beaches,
            imitating the look of lithographic printing and mid-20th century
            travel posters. This choice not only communicates the aesthetic of
            the watches but plays into the audience’s emotions of nostalgia to
            interest them in the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interactive elements include panning around the scenes, pressing
            and/or holding certain areas to trigger animations and sounds, and
            pressing buttons to play poetry. These immerse the viewer into the
            advertisement and scenes, ensuring their full attention, and
            reinforcing the emotional impact of the nostalgic scenery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can drag and spin a wheel with different nodes/dots to view
            different scenes. Numbers at the bottom of the screen seem to
            represent the time, scenes transitioning from bright blue, early
            morning to orange and red sunset. The use of the circular control
            seems to represent the imagery of a watch. The use of the watch
            imagery and cycling through time via retro imagery conveys a sense
            of an emotional importance of watches and time to the viewer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the user reaches the end, a button saying “Discover Your
            Journey” takes the viewer to an advertisement of the watches itself,
            with buttons linking to the Richard Mille site for the watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of interactive animations and poetry to tell a story helps
            communicate Richard Mille’s brand identity. Richard Mille watches
            are a luxury item known for their groundbreaking designs. The use of
            this interactive storytelling medium tells communicates the idea
            that the watch is deeply meaningful and important, justifying its
            luxury price point. Furthermore, the use of a modern and
            non-traditional form of advertising conveys the idea that Richard
            Mille watch designs are groundbreaking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
          <p>
            It seems to be designed to be interacted with once. I would imagine
            a user would probably not be expected to spend longer than 10
            minutes with the experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
          <p>
            The interaction is mostly linear (though the user can go backwards
            and forwards through the scenes) and gives one outcome, so there is
            little replay value. As it is an advertisement for a product, and
            web based, it is unlikely the experience will be accessible and live
            on the web for longer than the product is for sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The encouragement of the user to explore, pan around and interact
            with the scenes suggests they should invest a reasonable amount of
            time and attention to the experience. The use of poetry,
            storytelling and animations communicates that this is an art piece
            and demands attention and careful admiration from the viewer. - If a
            user interacts with everything in the experience, I estimate that it
            would take around 5 to 10 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
          <p>
            The art style of the animations references mid-20th century travel
            posters through the beach imagery, bright solid colours and an
            appearance which imitates lithographic printing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experience features poetry which is displayed along with the
            animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experience references the watches it is advertising in several
            ways: the bright colours which recall the watches’ Memphis Group
            influenced design, the RM 07-01 watch is directly mentioned and
            advertised at the beginning and end, and through the circular time
            control used to view different scenes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
          when engaging with your research experience?
          <p>
            The use of the poetry and travel poster influenced imagery
            communicates to the viewer that they should take time to explore the
            scenery and admire the images as artworks and storytelling rather
            than as an advertisement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The direct references to the watch’s name, by contrast, communicate
            to me that the experience is an advertisement, and shouldn’t be
            analysed as someone’s personal expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of the watch imagery in the circular control communicates
            that you are using it to explore through linear time and encourages
            you to progress time forward to experience the complete story.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
          <p>
            The use of the retro travel poster influenced imagery communicates
            that the viewer should feel emotions of nostalgia, as well as the
            feelings of relaxation and pleasure associated with vacations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nostalgic feeling is reinforced by the watch imagery and time
            controls, evoking the connection between emotions and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experience aims to connect these emotions with the product,
            making users feel compelled to purchasing it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part frustrating?
          <p>
            When a scene has an interactive (glowing) element, there is no
            indication of how it should be interacted with (should it be pressed
            or held? will it make a sound or animation?). This makes the
            experience confusing, as it is not always clear whether you are
            making the correct interaction or getting the intended feedback.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?
          <p>
            The most satisfying part of the interaction for me is the ability to
            pan the scenes. This allows users to admire and explore the artwork
            and take the experience at their own desired pace.
